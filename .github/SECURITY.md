## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Scape Ventures team takes all security vulnerabilities very seriously. 
Thank you for improving the security of our open source software. 
We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions. 
Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities by emailing the 
Scape Ventures team at:

**[security@scape.ventures](mailto:security@scape.ventures)**. 


You will receive a response from the lead maintainer as soon as possible, 
indicating the next steps in handling your report.
If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible, 
depending on complexity but historically within a few days.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will endeavor 
to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, 
and may ask for additional information or guidance.


## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it
to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
  * Release the fixes as fast as possible.
